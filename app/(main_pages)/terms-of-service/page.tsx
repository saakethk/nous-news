                <h1 className="main_heading">Terms of Service</h1>
                <p>ItsNous is a platform where users can read news, discuss news, comment on news, and view playlists of stories. Nous&rsquo;s terms of use apply to all users of the Nous websites and mobile applications. &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nous News&rdquo; refers to ItsNous. &ldquo;Nous,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the service&rdquo; refers to the website, mobile applications, products, software and any other services offered by us. &ldquo;Content&rdquo; includes the text, user comments, user discussions, snippets, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the service.</p>
                <p>These terms of use apply to all free and premium Subscribers. By accessing, using, visiting, or browsing the service, you accept and agree to be bound by these terms of use. You acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms of use. You also agree to any other policies we post on ItsNous. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these terms of use, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version online. ItsNous may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these terms of use at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions by continuing to use the service. If you do not agree to these terms of use, you must not access the service.</p>
                <h1 className="heading">How it Works</h1>
                <p>All users are managed via Clerk [&ldquo;<a href="https://www.clerk.com">https://www.clerk.com</a>&rdquo;] and subject to their terms and policies. Free users are able to create discussions, comment on discussions, view stories, and view snippets with certain rate limits. The rate limits can change at any time and ItsNous holds the ability to not disclose these rate limits. For premium users, all payments are handled by Stripe. Hence you agree to Stripe&rsquo;s terms of service [&ldquo;<a href="https://stripe.com/legal/ssa">https://stripe.com/legal/ssa</a>&rdquo;] when you agree to ItsNous terms of service. All users will be able to manage their user preferences and policies either via Clerk or Stripe.</p>
                <p>There are verified sources that are added to the ItsNous platform through RSS feeds or direct contracts. These sources are then parsed via APIs and the stories are scraped from urls or directly pulled via APIs. The scraped information is then filtered into stories and summaries. These stories and summaries are presented to users as &ldquo;Stories&rdquo; or &ldquo;Story&rdquo;. Users can then interact with these stories in multiple ways including but not limited to liking the story, starting a &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo;, viewing a similar story, or viewing the story&rsquo;s original source.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Stories&rdquo; can then be grouped into &ldquo;Snippets&rdquo; which are collections of stories. Users can interact with each story in a &ldquo;Snippet&rdquo; individually and rate their satisfaction with the Snippet as a whole at the end.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Discussions&rdquo; are content generated by users which discuss the stories they are linked to. &ldquo;Comments&rdquo; are content generated by users which apply to a discussion. ItsNous is not responsible and cannot be held accountable for actions surmounting from content on Nous.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>By using the service, you acknowledge and agree to receive, without further notice or prompting, updated versions of the service and related third-party software. We reserve the right to adjust subscription fees in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Any price changes to subscription fees will take effect following email notice to you, unless and except otherwise expressly provided for in these terms of use. All payments in relation to the service are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may, however, grant refunds at our sole discretion in exceptional circumstances.</p>
                <p>In certain situations you may lose access to Premium features. These include when you cancel your subscription, your payment method fails, you are banned from the platform, you delete your account, or you break these terms of use.</p>
                <p>We are constantly testing out new features with the goal of making Nous better. We may add or remove features, and often test features with a random subset of our users. If we believe a feature is significantly different from these terms, then we explain those differences in the test.</p>
                <h1 className="heading">Account</h1>
                <p>All accounts are created through Clerk [&ldquo;<a href="https://www.clerk.com">https://www.clerk.com</a>&rdquo;] authentication methods. Users are required to conform to both the provider&rsquo;s [Google, ect.] terms and Clerk&rsquo;s.</p>
                <p>You can permanently disable or have your account deleted at any time by going through Clerk&rsquo;s user management portal. If you choose to have your account disabled, you can see what information is deleted and what we continue to store after the account is disabled in our privacy policy.</p>
                <p>We can terminate or suspend your account at any time at our discretion. We can also cancel any subscriptions and remove any content or rewards at our discretion.</p>
                <p>These terms remain in effect after your account is disabled.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately.</p>
                <p>ItsNous cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.</p>
                <h1 className="heading">Communication Preferences</h1>
                <p>By using the service, you consent to receiving electronic communications from ItsNous relating to your account. Such communications shall include, without limitation, sending emails to your personal email address, posting communications on the website or in your account page on the website to communicate the following, without limitation: payment authorizations, payment method, changes of password, confirmation emails, and other transactional information, newsletters, special offers, promotional announcements and customer surveys. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal notice requirements, in writing or otherwise.</p>
